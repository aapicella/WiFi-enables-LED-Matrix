8x8 LED Matrix (all on at half brightness) approx 240mA  
5 x Matrices approx 1.2A  
When matrices are wired in series the power drop is too much by the fifth module and so the data lines start acting up. (Now I know why they are normally sold in packs of 4 !!!) To solve this I have powered 1 to 3 and 4 and 5 seperately (leaving the ground and data lines intact).  


Wemos D1 Mini Pro (peak pull with Wifi) approx 250mA

DS3231 approx 300uA  


Touch IC TTP223-BA6 (init Toggle Mode, Power on state = 0)
